          I've learned that systems make or break any effort no matter how
          well-intentioned. I came to technology knowing this career will allow
          me to take my passion for elevating others to an all new scale. Iâ€™m
          eager to join an ambitious development team, create tools that help
          others actualize their strengths, and ultimately make a difference.

          I'm a full stack developer, with skills in all aspects of the software
          building process. My passion for solving problems and finding creative
          solutions to remedy those challenges has lead me to a career in
          software development. I have found that most things I enjoy can be
          found in the creation of software which includes creative thinking,
          teamwork, problem solving, and design.

          Since I was young I've enjoyed picking apart problems and creating a
          strategy to solve them efficiently. From a base of playing strategy
          games competitively personally, I began developing my skills in a
          professional environment by doing logistics for tournaments. From
          this, I started teaching myself the fundamentals of programming
          online, and have fallen in love with it since then.

          I am a hard-working and motivated person who will give his all, no
          matter the job. While I may not have an extensive background in the
          tech industry, I have a proven track record across all of the
          positions I have previously held. My experience working for the US
          Postal Inspection Service has given me a strong background in critical
          thinking and data analysis and allows me to look at problems from a
          variety of angles and assess the pros and cons of each. I am able to
          plan and execute my work beyond what I am tasked with, and I am more
          than capable of working as part of a team, or on a more individual
          basis depending on the situation.
